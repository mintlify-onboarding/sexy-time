## Edit Locally (recommended for developers)

    1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
    2. Clone your deployment repo with the command `git clone <your-repo>`. You may need to set up [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) if you haven't before.
    3. Open the repo in your IDE of choice.
    4. Preview changes with our [Mintlify CLI](/development). Install with `npm i -g mintlify`

## Edit Online

There are two ways to edit your repo online.

- Find the edit button on the file you'd like to edit. This will open an in-line web editor in Github.

- Open your git repo in Github's [github.dev](https://github.dev) online IDE. Take the URL of your repo and replace `github.com` with `github.dev`. (e.g. `github.dev/mintlify/docs` instead of `github.com/mintlify/docs`)
